1. other assignment operators X
2.declaration assignment statements X
eg. int x = 5;
3.make all expressions work with variables not just consts X
eg. int x = z+y;
-----VARIABLES DONE------
1.Test compiler
2.**improper input** check that you dont add a symbol if its already in the current scope X
3.add nested scope logic X
4.if statements X
5.while loops X
6.less than or equal to wrong X
7.add return address logic X
8.things that need loops in expressions DOM X

-----BASIC DONE----------
1.for loops     DOM  X
2.local and global arrays LEO X
3.files containing multiple functions that call each other X
4.four arguments in functions LEO X
5.recursive function calls LEO X
6.the enum keyword DOM
7.switch statements DOM X
8.the break and continue keywords DOM X
9. break and default in switches X
10. comments, pointers and enum
------INTERMEDIATE DONE----------------------------------
1.variables of double, float, char, unsigned, structs, and pointer types

DONE----
2.calling externally-defined functions (i.e. the file being compiled declares a function, but its definition is provided in a different file that is linked in later on)
3.functions that take more than four parameters
4.mutually recursive function calls
5.locally scoped variable declarations (e.g. a variable that is declared inside the body of a while loop, such as while(...) { int x = ...; ... }. X
DONE----

6.the typedef keyword
7.the sizeof(...) function (which takes either a type or a variable)
8.pointers

9.character literals, including escape sequences like \n
10.strings (as NULL-terminated character arrays)
11.declaration and use of structs
